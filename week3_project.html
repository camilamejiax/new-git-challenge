      <ul>
        <li class="hh">The Hogwarts Houses</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Grynffindor ü¶Å:</strong> valued bravery, daring, nerve, and
          chivalry. Its emblematic animal was the lion, and its colours were
          scarlet and gold. Minerva McGonagall was the most recent Head of
          Gryffindor. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "Nearly
          Headless Nick", was the House Ghost. The founder of the House was
          Godric Gryffindor. Gryffindor corresponded to the element of Fire. The
          common room was located in one of the highest towers at Hogwarts, the
          entrance was situated on the seventh floor in the east wing of the
          castle and was guarded by a portrait of The Fat Lady. She permitted
          entrance if given the correct password, which was changed numerous
          times throughout the school year. Famous Gryffindors included Albus
          Dumbledore, Harry Potter, and Minerva McGonagall.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ravenclaw ü¶Ö:</strong> valued intelligence, knowledge,
          curiosity, creativity and wit. Its emblematic animal was the eagle,
          and its colours were blue and bronze. The Ravenclaw Head of House in
          the 1990s was Filius Flitwick. The ghost of Ravenclaw was the Grey
          Lady, who was the daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw, the House's founder.
          Ravenclaw corresponded to the element of air. The Ravenclaw common
          room and dormitories were located in a tower on the west side of the
          castle. Ravenclaw students must answer a riddle as opposed to giving a
          password to enter their dormitories. This riddle, however, could be
          answered by non-Ravenclaws. Famous Ravenclaws included Luna Lovegood,
          Gilderoy Lockhart, Ignatia Wildsmith (inventor of Floo powder), and
          Garrick Ollivander.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hufflepuff ü¶°: </strong>valued hard work, dedication,
          patience, loyalty, and fair play. Its emblematic animal was the
          badger, and yellow and black were its colours. Pomona Sprout was the
          Head of Hufflepuff during 1991‚Äì1998, Sprout left the post of Head of
          Hufflepuff and Herbology Professor sometime before 2017 and her
          successor for the position of Head of Hufflepuff was currently
          unknown. The Fat Friar was its ghost. The founder of the House was
          Helga Hufflepuff.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Slytherin üêç: </strong>
          valued ambition, leadership, self-preservation, cunning and
          resourcefulness and was founded by Salazar Slytherin. Its emblematic
          animal was the serpent, and its colours were emerald green and silver.
          Professor Horace Slughorn was the Head of Slytherin during the
          1997‚Äì1998 school year, replacing Severus Snape, who as well replaced
          Slughorn as Potions Professor when he retired for the first time
          several years prior. Slytherin had produced the most Death Eaters and
          Dark Wizards, including Tom Riddle, Bellatrix Lestrange and Lucius
          Malfoy, for example. But that does not mean that other Houses hadn't
          produced any; Peter Pettigrew was a Gryffindor, and Quirinus Quirrell
          was a Ravenclaw.
